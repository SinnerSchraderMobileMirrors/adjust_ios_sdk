## Summary

This is the guide to the iOS SDK of adjust.com™ for iOS apps which are using web views. 
You can read more about adjust.com™ at [adjust.com].

It provides a bridge from Javascript to native Objective-C calls (and vice versa) by using 
the [WebViewJavascriptBridge][web_view_js_bridge] plugin. This plugin is also licensed under 
`MIT License`.

## <a id="basic-integration">Basic integration

### <a id="step1">1. Add native adjust iOS SDK

In oder to use adjust SDK in your web views, you need to add native adjust iOS SDK to your app.
To install native iOS SDK of adjust, follow the `Basic integration` chapter of our 
[iOS SDK README][basic_integration].

### <a id="step2">2. Add the AdjustBridge to your project

In Xcode's `Project Navigator` locate the `Supporting Files` group (or any other
group of your choice). From Finder drag the `AdjustBridge` subdirectory into
Xcode's `Supporting Files` group.

![][bridge_drag]

In the dialog `Choose options for adding these files` make sure to check the
checkbox to `Copy items into destination group's folder` and select the upper
radio button to `Create groups for any added folders`.

![][bridge_add]

### <a id="step3">3. Integrate the AdjustBridge into your app

In the Project Navigator open the source file your View Controller. Add
the `import` statement at the top of the file. In the `viewDidLoad` or
`viewWillAppear` method of your Web View Delegate add the following
calls to `AdjustBridge`:

```objc
#import "Adjust.h"
// Or #import <AdjustSdk/Adjust.h>
// (depends on the way you have chosen to add our native iOS SDK.
// ...

UIWebView *webView = [[UIWebView alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];
// or with WKWebView:
// WKWebView *webView = [[NSClassFromString(@"WKWebView") alloc] initWithFrame:self.view.bounds];

AdjustBridge *adjustBridge = [[AdjustBridge alloc] init];
[adjustBridge loadUIWebViewBridge:webView];
// or with WKWebView:
// [_adjustBridge loadWKWebViewBridge:webView];

// ...
```

![][bridge_init_objc]

### <a id="step4">4. Integrate the AdjustBrige into your web view

To use the Javascript bridge of on your web view, it must be configured like the 
[WebViewJavascriptBridge plugin README][wvjsb_readme] is advising in section `4`.
Include the following Javascript code to intialize the adjust iOS web bridge:

```js
function setupWebViewJavascriptBridge(callback) {
    if (window.WebViewJavascriptBridge) {
        return callback(WebViewJavascriptBridge);
    }

    if (window.WVJBCallbacks) {
        return window.WVJBCallbacks.push(callback);
    }

    window.WVJBCallbacks = [callback];

    var WVJBIframe = document.createElement('iframe');
    WVJBIframe.style.display = 'none';
    WVJBIframe.src = 'wvjbscheme://__BRIDGE_LOADED__';
    document.documentElement.appendChild(WVJBIframe);

    setTimeout(function() { document.documentElement.removeChild(WVJBIframe) }, 0)
}

setupWebViewJavascriptBridge(function(bridge) {
    // AdjustBridge initialisation will be added in this method.
})
```

![][bridge_init_js]

#### <a id="basic-setup">Basic setup

In your HTML file, add references to the adjust Javascript files:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="adjust.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="adjust_event.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="adjust_config.js"></script>
```

Once you added references to Javascript files, you can use them in your
HTML file to initialise the adjust SDK:

```js
setupWebViewJavascriptBridge(function(bridge) {
    // ...

    var yourAppToken = '{YourAppToken}'
    var environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox
    var adjustConfig = new AdjustConfig(bridge, yourAppToken, environment)

    Adjust.appDidLaunch(adjustConfig)

    // ...
)}
```

![][bridge_init_js_xcode]

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your app token. You can find this in your
[dashboard].

Depending on whether you build your app for testing or for production, you must
set `environment` with one of these values:

```js
var environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox
var environment = AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction
```

**Important:** This value should be set to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` if 
and only if you or someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment 
to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentProduction` just before you publish the app. Set it back 
to `AdjustConfig.EnvironmentSandbox` when you start developing and testing it again.

We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and test traffic
from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value meaningful at
all times! This is especially important if you are tracking revenue.

#### <a id="adjust-logging">Adjust logging

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see in tests by calling
`setLogLevel` on your `AdjustConfig` instance with one of the following
parameters:

```objc
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelVerbose) // enable all logging
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelDebug)   // enable more logging
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelInfo)    // the default
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelWarn)    // disable info logging
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelError)   // disable warnings as well
adjustConfig.setLogLevel(AdjustConfig.LogLevelAssert)  // disable errors as well
```

### <a id="step5">5. Build your app

Build and run your app. If the build succeeds, you should carefully read the
SDK logs in the console. After the app launches for the first time, you should
see the info log `Install tracked`.

![][bridge_install_tracked]

## <a id="additional-features">Additional features

Once you integrate the adjust SDK into your project, you can take advantage of
the following features.

### <a id="step6">6. Set up event tracking

You can use adjust to track events. Lets say you want to track every tap on a
particular button. You would create a new event token in your [dashboard],
which has an associated event token - looking something like `abc123`. In your
button's `onclick` method you would then add the following lines to track
the tap:

```js
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent('abc123')
Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent)
```

When tapping the button you should now see `Event tracked` in the logs.

The event instance can be used to configure the event even more before tracking
it.

#### <a id="track-revenue">Track revenue

If your users can generate revenue by tapping on advertisements or making
in-app purchases you can track those revenues with events. Lets say a tap is
worth one Euro cent. You could then track the revenue event like this:

```js
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent('abc123')
adjustEvent.setRevenue(0.01, 'EUR')

Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent)
```

This can be combined with callback parameters of course.

When you set a currency token, adjust will automatically convert the incoming revenues 
into a reporting revenue of your choice. Read more about [currency conversion here.][currency-conversion]

You can read more about revenue and event tracking in the [event tracking guide][event-tracking-guide].

#### <a id="callback-parameters">Callback parameters

You can register a callback URL for your events in your [dashboard]. We will
send a GET request to that URL whenever the event gets tracked. You can add
callback parameters to that event by calling `addCallbackParameter` on the
event before tracking it. We will then append these parameters to your callback
URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL
`http://www.adjust.com/callback` then track an event like this:

```js
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent('abc123')
adjustEvent.addCallbackParameter('key', 'value')
adjustEvent.addCallbackParameter('foo', 'bar')

Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent)
```

#### <a id="partner-parameters">Partner parameters

You can also add parameters to be transmitted to network partners, for the
integrations that have been activated in your adjust dashboard.

This works similarly to the callback parameters mentioned above, but can
be added by calling the `addPartnerParameter` method on your `AdjustEvent`
instance.

```js
var adjustEvent = new AdjustEvent('abc123')
adjustEvent.addPartnerParameter('key', 'value')
adjustEvent.addPartnerParameter('foo', 'bar')

Adjust.trackEvent(adjustEvent)
```

You can read more about special partners and these integrations in our
[guide to special partnersd.][special-partners]

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

    http://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}`
that can be used as parameter values. In the resulting callback this
placeholder would be replaced with the ID for Advertisers of the current
device. Also note that we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only
append them to your callbacks. If you haven't registered a callback for an
event, these parameters won't even be read.

You can read more about using URL callbacks, including a full list of available
values, in our [callbacks guide][callbacks-guide].

### <a id="step7">7. Event buffering

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some
HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable
event buffering with your `AdjustConfig` instance:

```js
adjustConfig.setEventBufferingEnabled(true)
```

### <a id="step8">8. Disable tracking

You can disable the adjust SDK from tracking any activities of the current
device by calling `setEnabled` with parameter `false`. **This setting is remembered
between sessions**, but it can only be activated after the first session.

```js
Adjust.setEnabled(false)
```

<a id="is-enabled">You can check if the adjust SDK is currently enabled by calling 
the function `isEnabled`. It is always possible to activate the adjust SDK by invoking
`setEnabled` with the enabled parameter as `true`.

```js
Adjust.isEnabled(function(isEnabled) {
    if (isEnabled) {
        // SDK is enabled.    
    } else {
        // SDK is disabled.
    }
})
```

### <a id="step9">9. Offline mode

You can put the adjust SDK in offline mode to suspend transmission to our servers 
while retaining tracked data to be sent later. While in offline mode, all information 
is saved in a file, so be careful not to trigger too many events while in offline mode.

You can activate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with the parameter `true`.

```js
Adjust.setOfflineMode(true)
```

Conversely, you can deactivate offline mode by calling `setOfflineMode` with `false`.
When the adjust SDK is put back in online mode, all saved information is send to our
servers with the correct time information.

Unlike disabling tracking, this setting is *not remembered*
bettween sessions. This means that the SDK is in online mode whenever it is started,
even if the app was terminated in offline mode.

### <a id="step10">10. Send in the background

The default behaviour of the adjust SDK is to pause sending HTTP requests while 
the app is on the background. You can change this in your `AdjustConfig` instance:

```js
adjustConfig.setSendInBackground(true)
```

### <a id="step11">11. Device IDs

Certain services (such as Google Analytics) require you to coordinate Device and Client 
IDs in order to prevent duplicate reporting. 

To obtain the device identifier IDFA, call the function `getIdfa`:

```js
Adjust.getIdfa(function(idfa) {
    // ...
});
```

### <a id="step12">12. Set up deep link reattributions

You can set up the adjust SDK to handle deep links that are used to open your
app via a custom URL scheme. We will only read certain adjust specific
parameters. This is essential if you are planning to run retargeting or
re-engagement campaigns with deep links.

In the Project Navigator open the source file your Application Delegate. Find
or add the `openURL` and `application:continueUserActivity:restorationHandler:` 
and add the call to the `AdjustBridge` reference which exists in your view controller
which is displaying the web view:

```objc
#import "Adjust.h"
// Or #import <AdjustSdk/Adjust.h>
// (depends on the way you have chosen to add our native iOS SDK.
// ...

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    // This is how AdjustBridge is accessed in our example app.
    // Of course, you can choose on your own how to access it.
    [self.uiWebViewExampleController.adjustBridge sendDeeplinkToWebView:url];
    
    // Your logic whether URL should be opened or not.
    BOOL shouldOpen = [self yourLogic:url];
    
    return shouldOpen;
}

// ...

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application continueUserActivity:(NSUserActivity *)userActivity 
 restorationHandler:(void (^)(NSArray *restorableObjects))restorationHandler {
    if ([[userActivity activityType] isEqualToString:NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb]) {
        [self.uiWebViewExampleController.adjustBridge sendDeeplinkToWebView:[userActivity webpageURL]];
    }

    // Your logic whether URL should be opened or not.
    BOOL shouldOpen = [self yourLogic:url];
    
    return shouldOpen;
}
```

By adding this call to both of these methods, you will support deeplink reattributions 
for both - iOS 7 and lower (which uses old custom URL scheme approach) and iOS 8 and 
higher (which uses `universal links`).

**Important**: In order to enable universal links in your app, please read the
[universal links guide][ios_sdk_ulinks] from the native iOS SDK README.

In order to get deeplink URL info back to your web view, you should register a handle
on the bridge called `deeplink`. This method will then get triggered by the adjust SDK
once your app gets opened after clicking on tracker URL with deeplink information in it.

```js
setupWebViewJavascriptBridge(function(bridge) {
    bridge.registerHandler('deeplink', function(data, responseCallback) {
        // In this example, we're just displaying alert with deeplink URL content.
        alert('Deeplink:\n' + data)
    })
})
```

### <a id="step13">13. Attribution callback

You can register a callback method to be notified of tracker attribution
changes. Due to the different sources considered for attribution, this
information can not by provided synchronously.

Please make sure to consider our [applicable attribution data policies][attribution-data].

As the callback method is configured using the `AdjustConfig` instance, you
should call `setAttributionCallback` before calling `Adjust.appDidLaunch(adjustConfig)`.

```js
adjustConfig.setAttributionCallback(function(attribution) {
    alert('Tracker token = ' + attribution.trackerToken + '\n' +
          'Tracker name = ' + attribution.trackerName + '\n' +
          'Network = ' + attribution.network + '\n' +
          'Campaign = ' + attribution.campaign + '\n' +
          'Adgroup = ' + attribution.adgroup + '\n' +
          'Creative = ' + attribution.creative + '\n' +
          'Click label = ' + attribution.clickLabel)
})
```

The callback method will get triggered when the SDK receives final attribution data.
Within the callback you have access to the `attribution` parameter. Here is a quick 
summary of its properties:

- `var trackerToken` the tracker token of the current install.
- `var trackerName` the tracker name of the current install.
- `var network` the network grouping level of the current install.
- `var campaign` the campaign grouping level of the current install.
- `var adgroup` the ad group grouping level of the current install.
- `var creative` the creative grouping level of the current install.
- `var clickLabel` the click label of the current install.

### <a id="step14">14. Callbacks for tracked events and sessions

You can register a callback method to be notified of successful and failed tracked 
events and/or sessions.

Follow these steps and implement the following callback methods for successful 
tracked events:

```js
adjustConfig.setEventSuccessCallback(function(eventSuccess) {
    // ...
})
```

The following delegate callback function for failed tracked events:

```js
adjustConfig.setEventFailureCallback(function(eventFailure) {
    // ...
})
```

For successful tracked sessions:

```js
adjustConfig.setSessionSuccessCallback(function(sessionSuccess) {
    // ...
})
```

And for failed tracked sessions:

```js
adjustConfig.setSessionFailureCallback(function(sessionFailure) {
    // ...
})
```

The callback methods will be called after the SDK tries to send a package to the server. 
Within the callback methods you have access to a response data object specifically for that
callback. Here is a quick summary of the session response data properties:

- `var message` the message from the server or the error logged by the SDK.
- `var timeStamp` timestamp from the server.
- `var adid` a unique device identifier provided by adjust.
- `var jsonResponse` the JSON object with the response from the server.

Both event response data objects contain:

- `var eventToken` the event token, if the package tracked was an event.

And both event and session failed objects also contain:

- `var willRetry` indicates there will be an attempt to resend the package at a later time.

### <a id="step15">15. Callback for deferred deeplinks

You can register a callback method to get notified before a deferred deeplink 
is opened and decide whether the adjust SDK should open it or not.

This callback is also set on `AdjustConfig` instance:

```js
adjustConfig.setDeferredDeeplinkCallback(function(deferredDeeplink) {
    alert('Deferred deeplink:\n' + deferredDeeplink)
})
```

The callback function will be called after the SDK receives a deffered deeplink 
from ther server and before SDK tries to open it. 

With another setting on the `AdjustConfig` instance, you have the possibility to say
to our SDK should it try to open this link or not. You can do that calling the
`setOpenDeferredDeeplink` method:

```js
adjustConfig.setOpenDeferredDeeplink(true)
// Or if you don't want our SDK to open the link:
adjustConfig.setOpenDeferredDeeplink(false)
```

If you do not specify anything, by default, our SDK will try to open the link.
